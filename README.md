A neat video format made using text instead of pixels.

## What is this?
This is a simple file format that can be used to make videos out of text.
For example, you can turn a standard (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ into an animation of him flipping the table.

## How does it work?
AVF files aren't standard video files. They're actually plain text, powered by a really simple 'programming language' of sorts.
You don't need a fancy-pants editor or anything (although you could use one, if one exists). All you need is knowlege, an AVF player, and a text editor.

## How do I make a video?
Look at our docs.

## How do I make a player?
Also in the docs.

## Where are the docs?
Head over to the wiki tab, or just click here: [To the wiki!](https://github.com/SuperBoyne/ASCII-Video-Format/wiki)

## But why?
Mainly I did this for fun, but there are a few practical uses as well.
Mostly, you can use this in a terminal, so it's not limited to GUI only.
